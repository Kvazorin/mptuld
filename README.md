For a quick start:

1. Download web-server solution (XAMPP or similar);

2. Configure it according to your working directory and usable ports;

3. Download all files from 'main' branch;

4. Whilst you're in project's directory, initialize node_modules by typing in terminal (for Windows) following commands:
    - npm init -
    - npm install -

    Note that in this particular case you will install latest available versions for packages, described in package.json file
    Otherwise, check user manual on how to install other versions of packages on: https://docs.npmjs.com/ 

5. Startup your web-server solution, and go to localhost (by default);

6. Observe ;)
